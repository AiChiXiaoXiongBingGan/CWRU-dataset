# CWRU-dataset
Dataset for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery

**Our dataset** = *Normal Baseline Data* + *12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data*

Data was collected for normal bearings, single-point drive end and fan end defects.  Data was collected at 12,000 samples/second and at 48,000 samples/second for drive end bearing experiments.  All fan end bearing data was collected at 12,000 samples/second.  

Data files are in Matlab format.  Each file contains fan and drive end vibration data as well as motor rotational speed.  For all files, the following item in the variable name indicates:

**DE** - drive end accelerometer data  
**FE** - fan end accelerometer data  
**BA** - base accelerometer data  
**time** - time series data  
**RPM** - rpm during testing
